        What's Up! My name is Sama Sandy. A little about myself; I love all things and anything creative. I first cut my teeth on
        the creative edges a year after college. I taught myself Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign through online
        tutorials.
      </p>
      <p>
        From there I transitioned into web design learning basic HTML & CSS. Outside of web design, I also taught myself video editing.
        I primarily use Final Cut Pro but I also use Adobe Primere Pro and After Effects. In addition to video I also dabble
        a bit in music production and audio editing.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not in front of a computer screen I enjoy playing volleyball with my wife of 7 (almost 8 years) and being silly
        with 3 and half year old daughter. We are expecting our 2nd child in June and we are overjoyed when we found out
        it was a boy.
